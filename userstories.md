Project User Stories:

 As the marketing research team, we need a tool to accurately collect and chart feedback from potential customers in order to decide which products are most likely to sell. We'd need this to be random as to not skew opinions.

 As a developer, I want to make an adaptable program to randomly generate images from a directory. This will then give the user a chance to choose which item to select by clicking the with an input. This will also collect and store data that the user has selected.

 As a user to the site, I want a website that works efficiently and correctly. I also want a display and outline that is attractive and functional.
